#Strong components are components in graph where each node can be reachable from every other node
#we are condensating the strongly connected components of a larger graph
#strong components must be DAG (Directed acyclic graphs) because we there are cycles,
#   we are combining the vertices of that strong component into one super vertex
#Interview questions
#Airbnb | Cover all vertices with the least number of vertices
#Facebook | Minimum number of people to spread a message
